England won 4-3 on penalties against the South American side after the two teams could not be separated after 120 minutes - Harry Kane's penalty had been cancelled out by Yerry Mina in stoppage time.  
Kane, Marcus Rashford, Kieran Trippier and Eric Dier all scored their spot-kicks in the shootout, while Mateus Uribe's strike hit the crossbar and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford saved Carlos Bacca's effort.
